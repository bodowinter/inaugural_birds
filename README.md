# Readme

The two main analysis scripts are onomatopoeia.Rmd and sensory_words.Rmd in the scripts folder.

The sensory_words.Rmd analysis is currently based on an annotation of the first 1,000 random descriptions. The onomatopoeia.Rmd analysis uses the full data.

sensory_words.Rmd contains the analysis of distinctive words (lexical fields), including metaphor, as well as the analysis of comparisons and linguistic strategies more generally (including comparisons to onomatopoeia). The Topic Analysis in this script is obsolete (and not reported in the talk) but will be repeated once the full data has been annotated.

onomatopoeia.Rmd looks at all onomatopoeias and their characteristics.

Note:

- Latin species checked by Nigel Hopper
- spelling and punctuation checked by Michael Atherley
